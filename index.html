    <h2 class="btn btn-info">Vyasa's birth name is Krishna Dvaipayana, which refers to his dark complexion and
        birthplace.He is often
        referred to as "Veda Vyasa" (Veda Vyāsa) as he is believed to have arranged the single eternal Veda into
        four partsThe word "Vyasa" (Vyāsa) refers to "compiler," Other meanings are "split," "differentiate" or
        "describe." It is also a title, given to "a holy sage or a pious learned man," and applied to "persons
        distinguished for their writings."Hindus traditionally hold that Vyasa categorized the primordial single
        Veda into three canonical collections, and that the fourth one, known as Atharvaveda, was recognized as Veda
        only very much later. Hence he was called Veda Vyasa, or "Splitter of the Vedas," the splitting being a feat
        that allowed people to understand the divine knowledge of the Veda.</h2>
